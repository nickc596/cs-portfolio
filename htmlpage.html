<h1>Welcome</h1>
    <h2>What is HTML</h2>
    <p class="htmlinfo">HTML stands for hyper text markup language. When we use HTML it used to write the webpage. in HTML we use things called tags. we write tags by first having a opening tag which starts with a less than sign and cloe it with a greater than sign just like this <>. after were done putting the signs in we put in a command a common tag is a p tag which is used for writing a paragraph just like this.</p>
    <h2>What is CSS</h2>
    <P class="htmlinfo">CSS stands for cascading style sheets. CSS is used to put life into the webpage like adding a picture or a gif and even color like a backgroup color and text colors. That is only the surface when you look at a webpage and all the links and the cool stuff that goes on it is probably CSS that makes all that happen.</P>
    <h2>Sample Tags</h2>
    <p class="htmlinfo">Probably the most common tag in html is the p tag which have just shown. The p tag makes a paragraph all the white writing you see on this page is used with a p tag.<br>
    Another very common tag is a h1-h6. the h means a header. the large green and purple lettering is used with a h2 tag which i have attached a class to so they can have the same font size and color.<br>
    The last tag i will talk about today is the img tag which we use to put a picture onto the page. when we use the img tag we put a space and then a src which means source and then the url for the page because when w eput the src and then the url the computer knows to grab the picture from the source which is the url.</p>
